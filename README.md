##### Shiftstone Creator

You can create your own shiftstones using this app. This is considerably easier than the AssetBundle method but much more limited. You will have to build your shiftstone out of primitive shapes and many features are not implemented yet. TLDR; This is a work in progress.

You can create your object out of primitives and position, scale and rotate them how you see fit (If youre getting tired of manually inputting values try click and drag on the arrows) There are options for metallic, emission, color and the ability to give an object the shiftstone material. There is a charge stone model that you can base the size of your shiftstone off. When you are done, hit export and pick a location to save the file.

To load the shiftstone into the game, rename the file to the name of the shiftstone you want to replace in all caps (E.G: VIGOR, VOLATILE) and put it in the UserData/ShifstoneModels folder.
